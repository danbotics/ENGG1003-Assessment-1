Decrypted: ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY WALK INTO MORDOR. ITS BLACK GATES ARE GUARDED BY MORE THAN JUST ORCS. THERE IS EVIL THERE THAT DOES NOT SLEEP, AND THE GREAT EYE IS EVER WATCHFUL. IT IS A BARREN WASTELAND, RIDDLED WITHFIRE AND ASH AND DUST, THE VERY AIR YOU BREATHE IS A POISONOUS FUME. NOT WITH TEN THOUSAND MEN COULD YOU DO THIS. IT IS FOLLY.
